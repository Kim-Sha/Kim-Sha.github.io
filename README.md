  Kim Sha - Personal Website
</h1>

This personal website / blog is developed using Gatsby JS, and is hosted on GitHub Pages. View the live demo [here](https://kim-sha.github.io/), and track the project backlog on my [Kanban board](https://github.com/Kim-Sha/Kim-Sha.github.io/projects/1).

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Fork this repository.**

    While I haven't formalized this project into a gatsby starter, you're welcome to fork this repository to customize your own web application. Once you've made
    your own copy of this project in your GitHub account, you'll be the owner, and can clone it locally to develop on it as you please.

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd Kim-Sha.github.io/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the directory in your code editor of choice and make edits to the `src` or `contents`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll likely find in this repository:

    .
    ├── content
    ├── node_modules
    ├── public
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1. **`/content`**: This directory contains all of the data that will be queried by GraphQL and ultimately displayed on the website.

2. **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3. **`/public`**: When you `gatsby build` your project, all the elements of the static website are bundled into this folder.

4. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

5. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

6. **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

7. **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

8. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

9. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

10. **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

11. **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

12. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

13. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

14. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

_This project is built on Gatsby, an open-source front-end framework powered by React._

Looking for some guidance on buidling your own static website? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, Gatsby's own [in-depth tutorial for creating a site](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/) is a must-read.** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to their documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## 💫 Credits

Many elements of this static website were inspired by the [Intro.](https://github.com/wkocjan/gatsby-theme-intro) Gatsby theme created and open-sourced by [Wojciech Kocjan](https://kocjan.net/) from [Weeby Studio](https://weeby.studio/).
