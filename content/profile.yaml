  about: |
    Most recently a Data Science Intern at Square (Block, Inc.), I'm currently pursuing an MS in Applied Information Science at Cornell. I graduated from Princeton in 2019 with a BSE in Chemical & Biological Engineering, and was a Senior Data Scientist at CKM Analytix prior to Cornell. This website serves both as a portfolio and sandbox for me to write about data science in the context of urban technologies and sustainability.
