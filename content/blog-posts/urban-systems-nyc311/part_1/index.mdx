  Urban soft systems include the social, cultural, and economic networks that
  are critical to the human side of cities, but are comparatively invisible
  compared to hard (engineered) systems. This three-part series will look at
  a particularly salient system for residents of NYC: the 311 reporting service.

311 is a 'hotline' that users can dial to submit service requests for government
agencies to address. These agencies can then take this data and create work orders
for teams to fix the problems raised. This system exists primarily in urban
settings and covers non-emergency complaints such as noise, downed trees, and
illegally parked cars. One can think of it as a ticketing system that the NYC
government uses to receive, track, and prioritize urban issues. 311 reporting is
thus a soft system that helps orchestrate the healthy function of NYC municipal
services.

## NYC Open Data

The goal of this series of articles is to map and identify patterns in the
components that make up this system. Analyses leverage 4 sets of data from
[NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/):

1. [311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9): provides 311 reporting as far back as 2010, and is updated on an automated daily basis. Each record in this dataset corresponds to a 311 service request.
2. [NYC Community Boards](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Community-Boards/ruf7-3wgc) + [Community Districts](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Community-Districts/yfnk-k7r4): provides the locations of community boards mapped as nodes in the network, as well as neighborhood boundaries.
3. [Agency Service Center](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Agency-Service-Center/nn5y-wmuj): provides locations of agency service centers mapped as nodes in the network.
4. [311 Service Level Agreements](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/311-Service-Level-Agreements/cs9t-e3x8): describes and quantifies commitments that City Agencies have made to respond to 311 Service Requests in a timely manner.

## Aggregate Volumes

We focus in this article on developing a basic understanding of the scale of
operations. Since 2010, a whopping **31,942,335** service requests have flowed
through 311. Brooklyn has been a relatively large contributor to this flood of
requests:

|Borough        |Volume    |Fraction (%)|
|---------------|----------|------------|
|Brooklyn       |9,493,491 |29.7        |
|Queens         |7,432,616 |23.3        |
|Manhattan      |6,205,367 |19.4        |
|Bronx          |5,921,249 |18.5        |
|Staten Island  |1,603,867 |5.0         |

Usage of the system has grown too, with 3,164,062 requests having come in 2022.
This can be sliced by categorical fields such as `agency_name` and `complaint_type`:

    requests in 2022.

It's clear from Figure 1 that complaints handled by each agency are mutually exclusive.

## Temporal Trends and Outliers

### How has the medium through which users interact with the 311 system changed over time?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, service requests submitted by a 311 call center agent on
behalf of a customer (`PHONE`) has traditionally been the primary source of work.
It makes up ~47% of all requests submitted since 2010.

  <LazyPlot {...volume_by_medium} />

    Figure 2. Interactive visualization of demand over time coming from each
    medium that a user can submit a service request through.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Toggling the traces in Figure 2 above shows a clear dropoff in phone dominance
over the last 2 years, despite growing usage of 311 overall. Users appear to instead
be switching over to mobile / online usage of the 311 app. This is particularly
prominent in a growth spike during Summer 2020 driven by the mobile / online mediums
(more on this later).

### How have the complaint types changed over time?

Residential noise complaints alone describe ~10% of requests since 2010.
Over time, there have been spikes in volume for specific requests:

    common complaint types, accounting for ~44% of all requests since 2010.
    Note that <code>HEATING</code> has been re-categorized as
    <code>HEAT/HOT WATER</code> in March 2014. 
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Figure 3 above illustrates significant **periodicity** present in the data:
- Heating / hot water complaints spike in winter months when demand is known to peak.
- Noise complaints (especially from the street / sidewalk) spike in summer months
when city residents and traffic are relatively active.
- Complaints about street and street light conditions spike roughly every Spring
as well, when [roads tend to crack](https://weatherworksinc.com/news/why-do-potholes-form-in-spring).

### How has the volume of requests fielded by agencies changed over time?

The New York Police Department (NYPD) and Department of Housing Preservation and
Development (HPD) receive the most requests. Since 2010, their combined demand
makes up almost 53% of all 311 calls.

We can see how the periodicity described above bubbles up to the agencies
responsible for the complaint types as seasonal waves:
- The HPD faces most calls in winter months when heat/hot water is crucial.
- The NYPD faces most calls in summer months when residents are particularly active.

Certain agencies also fielded unprecedented surges in 311 calls in 2020 (double-click
traces in the legend to isolate specific agencies). Cross referencing with complaint
type and descriptors provides insight into likely driving factors, and allows us
to match these peaks up to events in the [COVID-19 pandemic timeline](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/nyregion/nyc-covid-timeline.html):

|Agency                                          |Peak (2020)|Driver / Context|
|------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
|[DCA](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/index.page)  |March      |7351 consumer complaints directed at retail stores during the [onset of COVID-19 lockdowns](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html).|
|[DFTA](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dfta/index.page)|April      |1774 missed delivery complaints during COVID-19 lockdowns directed at the Home Delivered Meals program for older adults.|
|[NYPD](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/index.page)|June       |> 87k noise complaints (both residential and street/sidewalk) coincide with Phase 2 of [NYC reopening](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/nyregion/phase-2-reopening-nyc.html) and the emergency of outdoor dining.|
|[DPR](https://www.nycgovparks.org/)             |August     |> 45k reports (~78%) are of fallen or damaged trees arising from [Tropical Storm Isaias](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/08/17/toppled-trees-topple-new-yorkers-as-city-tries-to-clear-isaias--mess#:~:text=Tree%20issues%20were%20the%20worst,according%20to%20the%20Parks%20Department.).|

#### When are people complaining?

As expected, a large chunk of requests occur during weekday working hours
(~40% Monday to Friday from 9AM - 5PM). It's also worth noting the peak that
occurs on Saturday nights, when noise complaints about late night party-goers
comprise almost half of all 311 service requests between 11PM - 1AM.

## Next Steps

As is becoming evident in the complaint types and descriptors above, the 311 network
is inherently intertwined with 'hard' systems such as:

1. the physical communications network infrastructure (mobile, internet networks)
that the system leverages in order to operate.
2. the hard physical infrastructure that are the subject of service requests:
transportation, water & sanitation, buildings etc.

Therefore, we may define the overall *network* as characterized by a set
of human processes and interactions that make it 'soft', but there are also
decidedly 'hard' elements that differ by geography. It makes sense then
to assess whether different regions are adequately served by city agencies.

**Part 2 of this series will focus more on mapping as a tool to conduct spatial
analysis of the presence of agency activity across different NYC boroughs.**
