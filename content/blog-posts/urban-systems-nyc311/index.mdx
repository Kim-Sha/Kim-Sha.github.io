  How do I build an automated ETL pipeline from a simple web scraper? Over two posts, I
  document the resources I leverage to periodically extract solar irradiance and
  meteorological data from the Solar Energy Research Institute's (SRRL) online portal.
  This second post will focus on automating the ETL pipeline.

**N.B. ArcGIS Map:** https://arcg.is/8ifnL

This analysis leverages 3 sets of data from NYC Open Data sources:
1. **[311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9):** provides 311 reporting as far back as 2010, and is updated on an automated daily basis. Each record in this dataset corresponds to a 311 service request.
2. **[NYC Community Boards](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Community-Boards/ruf7-3wgc) + [Community Districts](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Community-Districts/yfnk-k7r4):** (for the ArcGIS map) provides the locations of community boards described as nodes above, as well as neighborhood boundaries.
3. **[Agency Service Center](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Agency-Service-Center/nn5y-wmuj)**: (for the ArcGIS map) provides locations of agency service centers described as nodes above.
4. **[311 Service Level Agreements](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/311-Service-Level-Agreements/cs9t-e3x8):** Provides the time commitments that City Agencies have made to respond to 311 Service Requests that are assigned to them.
