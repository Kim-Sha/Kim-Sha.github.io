  Hello, and welcome to my first post! I will use this space to hazily outline a
  roadmap of sorts for the direction of this platform. Hopefully, I can introduce
  and document my interests here as I explore them (or more likely fall entirely
  short of following them through).

If you're here for an expertly designed and thoughtfully curated series of
insightful narratives, it'd be my pleasure to swiftly redirect you to the 
[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/). Better yet, if you know me personally,
and are wondering how this plebe got this far building his own web app, feel free
to follow through on your plans to spam my [inbox](/contact-form) anyway.

As you probably know by now, I'm Kim - a Data Scientist at CKM Analytix in New 
York. I'm Dutch, and grew up largely in the Middle East, but if you took a peek 
at my profile you may guess correctly that I'm of Chinese descent. I studied 
Chemical and Biological Engineering in college, and definitely remember at least
13% of my coursework.

While there, I developed an abiding interest in data science, particularly when
framed in the context of sustainability and renewable energy. For the time being,
I'll revisit some of those themes, and attempt to touch upon different lessons I've
picked up along the way. There'll be some vanilla exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
some machine learning, and even a series on clean energy innovators and the
important contributions they're making.

I initially created this website to gain some hands-on experience in fundamental
concepts of frontend development. Now, I think it'll also serve as a good sandbox
for me to present my explorations in an accessible, engaging and focused manner 
(though you won't find that in this meandering mess).
After all, I'm a firm believer in telling stories through visualized data.
Indeed, it occasionally even reveals some truths to us about the world
we live in. What's that George Box quote again?

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

Certainly, that's what I'd say in middle school when I would report experimental
results with an uncertainty of +/- 130%.

If you've made it this far, it's probably become quite apparent to you that I'm
grasping aimlessly at non-existent straws here. If you're tired of my floundering,
and have any ideas you'd like to toss my way, please get in touch!
