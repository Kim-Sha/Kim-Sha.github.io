A visceral yet often transient affair,
Flawed as the faith by which it is governed,
Drawn in, as one is, by the beauty of the lair.

That which is said to transcend both space and time,
Yet is imprisoned by its own calcium cage,
And stifled amidst a mass of blurred lines.

I claimed sovereignty over it with the gentlest of murmurs,
Social sensibilities cast away in blind passion,
One after another as if no one else had ever experienced that fervor.

Then out of the depths of the shadows I shall wade,
An inexorable march to that genuine light,
Like a bastion against the waning of the fight.
